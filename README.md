# Introduction

In this project I created a 2D shooter game with animals and a pizza gun and keyboard technology implementation. Everytime pizza hits a animal its destroyed and gives user 1 point and if user can’t hit a animal before it reaches out of bounds it decreases point. If your score is below 0 it’s game over.Core gameplay mechanics contain moving your character right to left in given map borders whilst shooting the animals who are running bottom to out of bounds. Targeted platform for this game is Windows and MAC PC. 
Scope of the project is cost wise zero to none because I used free textures and Unity ‘s free to use features. Licenses used in this game are Microsoft Visual Studio licenses, Textmesh Pro

# Gameplay, Animation & Code

Shooter game is played by one player who is trying to keep their score above 0. Some of the animals decrease total score by 2,3 or 5 and each successful pizza hit gives 1 point. So back to back horse might cause you to lose the game all together. Animation wise the game requires animals to have a sort of movement and those movements are in the _Source_Files folder.

And the main goal of the game and whole scoring elements are recorded in PlayerController script since it's the deciding factor of winning condition.
